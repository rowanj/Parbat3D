Parbat3D was designed and developed by a team of 5 3rd-year Bachelor of Computing students at the University of Tasmania's Hobart campus during 2006.

It was created to fulfil the requirements of Dr. Arko Lucieer, to display and visualize data from satellite imagery.

Dr. Lucieer's concept implementation, Parbat - was developed in Java some two years earlier, and is hosted at
