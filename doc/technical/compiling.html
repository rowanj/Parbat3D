<h1>Compiling Parbat3D</h1>


<p>
Parbat 3D is developed using Bloodshed Dev-C++
</p>

<h2>Obtaining the Source</h2>
<p>
The development source tree for parbat is publically available from own SubVersion repository at:<br />
https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/parbat/trunk
</p>
<p>
In order to download the latest version of the source code, you will need to obtain an SVN client, such as <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortiseSVN</a> and follow its instructions to download from the above URL.
</p>

<h2>Setting up your Development Environment</h2>
<p>
To compile from source, you will need to have the GDAL libraries and headers installed.  You can obtain these as a ZIP archive from the developer package on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/parbat">SourceForge.net file release system</a>.
</p>

<p>
You will need to un-pack the archived directory into the top level of the Parbat3D source tree.
</p>

<p>
In order to compile your software you will also need to a copy of the Bloodshed <a href="http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html">Dev-C++ IDE</a>. This document will describe how to compile using version 4.9.9.2.
</p>


<h2>Setting up your Runtime Environment</h2>

<p>
In order to actually run the compiled executable, you will need to unzip the DLL runtime archive from our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/parbat">SourceForge.net file release system</a> into the directory you have the copiled executable in (by default, the top-level build directory).
</p>

<p>
We have taken great care to package all the required libraries, although we may have missed one or two, if you have any further library problems at run-time, please post in our support forums.
</p>

<h2>Compiling The Source Code</h2>
<p>
Once you have setup your development and runtime environments and downloaded the source code, open the project file parbat3d.dev in Dev-C++. The parbat3d.dev file should be located in the 
top level of the Parbat3D source tree.
</p>
<p>
Once the Parbat3D project file has been opened, click on 'Compile & Run' from the 'Execute' menu within Dev-C++.
