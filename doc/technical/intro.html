<hr />

<p>The Parbat3D techincal documentation is intended for developers and interested open source hackers who wish to submit bug fixes, extend the functionality of the program, or are just interested in how the tool is written.</p>
<p>The language used is fairly jargon-heavy, and is aimed at a programmer with a number of years experience.</p>
<p>Parbat3D was written as a final year software project, and is not as polished as a commerical application.</p>
<p>The walkthroughs for each sourcecode section, coupled with the OO diagrams and the control flow documentation should allow you to locate the section of the code that interests you.</p>
<p>For further technical assistance, you can also post to the <a href="mailto:parbat-team@lists.sourceforge.net">Parbat 3D mailing list</a>.</p>
