<hr />

<p>
The Parbat 3D Project file organizes the source and resource files into several conceptual packages for ease of managment. The groupings of files is intended to be by scope of functionality, however it has turned out that the actual grouping of the finalised version depends largely on the semantics and beaurocracies of such projects.
</p>

<h2>Feature Space PKG</h2>
<p>
This contains classes to do solely with creating, managing, and drawing the 3-D feature space window(s).
</p>

<h2>Image File PKG</h2>
<p>
This package provides the central ImageFile and ImageProperties classes from which many areas of the project retrieve image data, along with various wrapper and helper classes to better abstract the project from the workings of the underlying GDAL libraries.

<h2>Image Manipulation PKG</h2>
<h2>Region of Interest PKG</h2>
<h2>Settings PKG</h2>
<h2>View PKG</h2>
