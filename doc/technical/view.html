<h2>View</h2>
<p>The View package consists of a group of source files that are responsible for displaying windows, handling events and 
interfacing with the Windows API. It also handles starting and quiting the application, which includes constructing and 
deconstructing objects from the other packages as they are required. Each of the main windows have been seperated into 
their own class, which extends from a general Window class that contains most of the common functionality.

<h3>Windows</h3>
<h4>The General Window Class</h4>
<p>
The Window class is resposible for creating the main windows through the Windows API and associating them with their own 
c++ objects. It also contains code to handle certain events that are common between all of the main windows (see Event Handling). 
These common events include global key shortcuts, sticking and dragging windows around the screen and destroying windows. Some 
simple functions are also included to wrap around the Window API.
</p>

<h4>Main Window</h4>
<p>
The Main Window is an off-screen window that is not visible to the users. All of the other windows are "owned" by this window. 
Its purpose was to be used as the window that appears in the taskbar, that will automatically minimize and restore the other
windows as required. This has now been acheived in a better way, by showing the Overview window in the taskbar instead.
</p>
<p>
The main purpose of the Main Window now is to hide, show, enable and disable all of the other windows when required.
</p>

<h4>Overview Window</h4>
<p>
The Overview Window is considered to the user to be the "main window" of the application. It is the only window that appears 
when the program starts up. The job of the overview window is to show an overview of the image that is currently open (if there is 
one) and to provide the main functions of the program to the user through the use of a menu bar. Apart from the Feature Space 
Windows, it is the only window that can be minimized to the task bar. Minimizing and restoring this window minimizes and 
restores the remaining windows that do not appear on the task bar. The overview of the image is displayed using the Display 
Window class.
</p>

<h4>Image Window</h4>
<p>
The Image Window is a resizable window that displays the currently loaded image. It handles navigating and zooming the image by 
both keyboard shortcuts and scrollbars. The image is displayed inside the window using the Display Window class.

<h4>Tools Window</h4>

<h4>Feature Space Window</h4>
