<h2>In-Brief</h2>

<p>
Parbat 3D uses common package distribution techniques to allow the installation of the most recent release to be as quick, and user-friendly as possible.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Obtaining</h2>
<p>
The most recent packaged release, project news, and development source can be found at the <a href="http://parbat.sourceforge.net/">project website</a>, along with any updated documentation, or other resources.
</p>

<p>
Once you have downloaded or otherwise obtained the package you wish to install, the process of installation is straightforward.
</p>

<p>
Double-click the package file to get started.
</p>

<h2>Step-by-step</h2>
<h3>1. Language Selection</h3>
