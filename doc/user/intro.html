<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Satellite imagery is increasingly being used for Earth observation, mapping, observations of climate change and feature detection. Numerous satellites are orbiting the Earth to map and monitor land cover, weather, topography, geology, vegetation, oceans, and ice. The advance in technology has resulted in satellite sensors that can detect objects smaller than one meter and sensors that can record information from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (visible, infrared, thermal infrared, and radar). All of this leads to huge amounts of data in the form of large image files consisting of millions of pixels in several bands. Efficient display of these images has become a challenge and visualisation is very important for effective analysis of satellite imagery.</p>
<p>Parbat3D is a tool for visualising these satellite images. It allows very large images that may have multiple bands to be viewed quickly and easily. The images can be viewed as the standard 2D image or plotted to a 3D feature space, which is a scatterplot of all the pixels in the image. Parbat3D also allows the Regions of Interest to be selected in the 2D image and these will show up in the feature space.</p>
