<p>Remote sensing is the science of taking measurements from a distance. Broadly, it covers any method of taking measurements whereby the object being measured is not in physical contact (or even proximity) with the sensor. More specifically, remote sensing refers to using remote sensors mounted on sensor platforms to take readings of geographical features.</p>

<p>Remote sensors detect electromagnetic radiation. Each sensor detects only certain wavelengths of radiation; this is the "band" that the sensor operates in. These bands are measured by the length of the wave (nanometres, micrometres, millimetres).</p>

<p>Many of the bands fall within regions of the electromagnetic spectrum that many of us would be familiar with: radar, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet and visible light.</p>

<p>Sensor platforms can be of a variety of types, but the prototypical ones are the satellite and the aeroplane. A platform may mount many sensors.</p>

<p>Sensors have both a resolution (the number of samples in a given block of data, often viewed as pixels) and a data depth (how many distinct levels of intensity can be recorded for a given sensor). Many platforms have a large number of low resolution but large depth sensors, and provide information about a variety of different bands. Others focus on just a few very high resolution sensors.</p>

<p>Remote sensing data is typically represented as an image on a screen, and file sizes can become very large indeed (multi-gigabyte).</p>
