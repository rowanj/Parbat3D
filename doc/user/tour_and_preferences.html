<h1>Tour of Main Features</h1>

<h2>Viewing Images</h2>

<h3>Loading Images</h3>

<p>Before you can do anything useful
with Parbat 3D, you must first load an image. To load an image, follow
these steps:</p>

<ol>

  <li>Click on the &lsquo;File&rsquo; menu, followed by
&lsquo;Open&rsquo;.</li>

  <li>Choose the file type you are looking for. The
default option shows all JPEG, &hellip; images. If you
can&rsquo;t see your image file,
trying changing the file type to &lsquo;All Files
*.*&rsquo;.&nbsp;</li>

  <li>Select the image file you wish to display and click
Ok. After the image has loaded, you should be able to see the whole
image
displayed in the Overview window. An Image window will also be
displayed
showing you the top-left position of the image at the default zoom
level.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Navigating An Image</h3>

<p>The image can be navigated in the
Image Window in
a number
of different ways. Before the image can be navigated, the Image Window
must first be highlighted. To highlight the Image Window, click on its
title bar.</p>

<p>Panning the image:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>

  <li>Move the scrollbars left/right or up/down.</li>

  <li>Click and hold the left mouse button, move the mouse and
then release the left mouse button</li>

</ul>

Zooming the image:<br>

<ul>

  <li>Move your mouse wheel up/down.</li>

  <li>Press 'Page Up', or 'Page Down'.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Displaying Different Bands</h3>

<p>Parbat 3D allows you to open image
files that
contain
multiple different image bands. By default, Parbat 3D displays the
image using
the first three bands of the image, which normally correspond to the
red, green and blue components of visible light. To change which bands
are displayed, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>

  <li>If the Tools Window is not already visible, click on the
'Window' menu followed by 'Tools'.</li>

  <li>Click on the 'Display' tab within the Tools Window.</li>

  <li>Underneath the 'R' (red) display channel column, click a
the
radio button that lines up with the image band that you want to display
as the red channel. The default is 'Band&nbsp;1'.</li>

  <li>Underneath the 'B' (blue) display channel column, click a
the radio
button that lines up with the image band that you want to display as
the red channel. The default is 'Band 2'.</li>

  <li>Underneath the 'G' (green) display channel column, click a
the radio
button that lines up with the image band that you want to display as
the red channel. The default is 'Band 3'.</li>

  <li>Click 'Update' to save the changes. The Image and Overview
windows will be updated to display the chosen bands.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Regions of Interests</h2>

Regions of Interests (ROI's) are a set of areas on an image that are of
interest. ROIs can be created by the user and given specific names and
colours. Each ROI can consist of multiple different areas, or
'entities' on the image. <br>

<br>

Parbat 3D stores a list of ROIs in memory and allows this list to be
saved to and from an ROI file, seperate to the image.<br>

<h3>Displaying the ROI Window</h3>

Before you can use ROIs, the ROI Window must be visible. To make the
ROI Window visible, click on the 'Window' menu followed by 'ROI
Window'.
<h3>Creating a Region Of Interest</h3>

To create a Region Of Interest, click on the '+' button within the ROI
Window toolbar. An ROI will be added to the ROI Window with a default
name and colour.
<h3>Creating Entities Within An ROI</h3>

There are three different types of entities (areas of interest) within
the image that you can create. These are points, rectangles and
polygons. <br>

<br>

To create a rectange entity, follow these steps:<br>

<ol>

  <li>Select/highlight the ROI that will contain the entity (area
of interest).</li>

  <li>Click on the rectangle button within the ROI Window toolbar.</li>

  <li>Click the left mouse button on the Image Window at the
top-left point of the area that you are interesed in.</li>

  <li>Click the left mouse button on the Image Window at the
bottom-right point of area that you are interested in.</li>

</ol>

To create a polygon entity, follow these steps:<br>

<ol>

  <li>Select/highlight the ROI that will contain the entity (area
of interest).</li>

  <li>Click on the polygon button within the ROI Window toolbar.</li>

  <li>Click the left mouse button on the Image Window to create
the first point of the polygon that you are interesed in.</li>

  <li>Keep clicking the left mouse button on the Image Window to
create more points as required.</li>

  <li>Double-click the left mouse button on the Image Window to
end the
polygon. The last point will be automatically joined to the first point.</li>

</ol>

To create a point entity, follow these steps:<br>

<ol>

  <li>Select/highlight the ROI that will contain the entity (area
of interest).</li>

  <li>Click on the point button within the ROI Window toolbar.</li>

  <li>Click the left mouse button on the Image Window at the
point within the image that interests you.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Modifying a Regions Of Interest</h3>

To change a ROI's colour, follow these steps:<br>

<ol>

  <li>Within the ROI Window, click on the colour box next that
appears next to the name of the ROI that you want to change.</li>

  <li>Select a colour from the colour dialog box and click 'Ok'.</li>

</ol>

To change the name of an ROI, follow these steps:<br>

<ol>

  <li>Select the ROI you wish to change by clicking once on its
name.</li>

  <li>Wait for a couple of seconds.</li>

  <li>Click on the name of the ROI again.</li>

  <li>Type in a new name.</li>

  <li>Press 'enter' to update the name, or 'Esc' to cancel the
change.</li>

</ol>

To delete an ROI, follow these steps:<br>

<ol>

  <li>Select the ROI you wish to delete by clicking once on its
name.</li>

  <li>Click on the '-' button within the ROI Window toolbar.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Saving Regions Of Interests</h3>

The whole list of ROIs can be saved to a file by following these steps:<br>

<ol>

  <li>Click on the save button within the ROI Window toolbar.</li>

  <li>Choose a location, type in a filename and click 'Ok'.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Loading Regions Of Interests</h3>

A whole list of ROIs can be loaded from a file by following the steps
below. Note that ROIs can be loaded on top of a different image to the
one that they were originally created on.<br>

<ol>

  <li>Click on the load button within the ROI Window toolbar.</li>

  <li>Choose a file and click 'Ok'.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Feature Space</h2>

<h3>Generating a Feature Space</h3>

Parbat3D can generate a Feature Space, or 3D scatter plot, from data
contained within the points of an image. To create a Feature Space
based on the currently loaded image, follow these steps:<br>

<ol>

  <li>If the Tools Window is not visible, click on the 'Window'
menu followed by 'Tools'.</li>

  <li>Click on the 'Feature' tab in the Tools Window.</li>

  <li>Select which image bands you want to display as the X, Y
and Z variables on the scatter plot.</li>

  <li>Change the granuality setting if required. Increasing the
granuality will reduce the number of points generated and therfore
decrease the loading time.</li>

  <li>Click the 'Generate' button.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Navigating a Feature Space</h3>

The feature space can be rotated by doing the following:<br>

<ul>

  <li>Press and hold the left mouse button within the feature
space, move the mouse, then release the left mouse button.</li>

</ul>

The feature space can be zoomed in/out by doing the following:<br>

<ul>

  <li>Press and hold the right mouse button within the feature
space, move the mouse forward/back, then release the right mouse button.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Changing The Window Layout</h2>

<h3>Hiding / Showing Windows</h3>

The Overview window remains visible all of the time, unless minimized.
Clicking on the 'X' close button at the top-right of the window will
close the program.<br>

<br>

The extra windows can be shown/hidden by using the 'Window' menu, as
mentioned throughout this tour. Each window listed under the 'Window'
menu has a tick next to it if it is currently visible, or no tick if it
is hidden. To change the visibility state of a window, simply click on
one of the menu items. If a 'Window' menu item appears to be grayed out
or disabled, it can not be used during the current state of the program
and therefore can not be shown.<br>

<br>

The extra windows can also be hidden by clicking on the 'X' close
button button at the top-right of the window.
<h3>Snapping Windows</h3>

Parbat3D allows each of windows to be moved around independantly, or
snapped together and moved around with the Overview Window. <br>

<br>

To move a window, press and hold the left mouse button on its title
bar, move the mouse, then release the mouse button. <br>

<br>

To snap a window to another one, simply move it towards the second
window until they touch each other. <br>

<br>

To move multiple windows around the screen at the same time, snap them
all to the Overview Window and then move the Overview Window with the
mouse.
<h3>Resizing The Image Window<br>

</h3>

The Image Window can be resized by pressing and holding the left mouse
button down on a corner of the window, moving the mouse, then releasing
the left mouse button. <br>

<br>

The Image Window can also be maximized by clicking on the maximize
button at the top-right area of the window.<br>

<br>

<h3>Saving The Window Layout</h3>

The positions of the main windows are automatically saved and restored
when you close and re-open Parbat 3D. See 'Preferences' section for
more inforation.
<h1>Preferences</h1>

<h3>Editing Preferences</h3>

The preferences can be modified by opening preferences window. To do
this, click on the 'Window' menu followed by 'Preferences'. The
preferences window will show the current preference settings and allow
you to make changes. Clicking the 'Ok' button will accept the modified
settings, but, the new settings won't take effect until you close and
re-start Parbat3D. See below for a description of the preferences found
in the Preferences Window.<br>

<br>

<h3>The 'Cache size' setting:</h3>

Parbat3D loads images in multiple different sections. Each of the
sections&nbsp;are partially stored in memory, known as a cache, as
they
are loaded in order to reduce the amount of data that needs to be read
from disk every time the user pans or zooms. The 'Cache size' setting
allows the user to specify how much memory should be used to store this
cache. The larger this value is, the quicker you may be able to pan and
zoom the image. However, setting this value too high could cause your
system to run out of available memory. It is recommended to set this
value well below the amount of RAM your system has available.
<h3>The 'Texture dimension' setting:</h3>

The 'Texture dimension'&nbsp;is related to the 'Cache size'
setting. It
allows the user to set the size of the different sections that are
stored in the cache. By setting this to a larger value, the user may be
able to pan futher around the image before more data is required to
read from the disk. However, if this value is too high, there won't be
enough room in the cache to store multiple different sections and
Parbat3D will be forced to read from the disk every time you pan or
zoom.<br>

<br>

<h3>The 'Display open file warning' setting:</h3>

The 'Display open file warning' setting allows you to turn off the
warning box that is displayed when a user attempts to close the program
with an image currently open. If this setting is turned on, the user is
asked to confirm that they want to quit. If this setting is turned off,
no warning is given to the user and the program will quit straight
away.
<h3>The Parbat3D Settings File</h3>

The Parbat3D settings file is stored in the current user's Window's
account. This means that multiple different users can use Parbat3D with
their own preferences and window layout. If Parbat3D is run while a
particular user is logged on, then closed and run again when a
different user is logged in, the preferences that it uses may be
different.<br>
