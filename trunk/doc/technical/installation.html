<h1>Installation</h1>

<p class="indexlink"><a href="index.html">Back to Contents</a></p>

<hr />

<h2>In-Brief</h2>

<p>
Parbat 3D uses common package distribution techniques to allow the installation of the most recent release to be as quick, and user-friendly as possible.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Obtaining</h2>
<p>
The most recent packaged release, project news, and development source can be found at the <a href="http://parbat.sourceforge.net/">project website</a>, along with any updated documentation, or other resources.
</p>

<p>
Once you have downloaded or otherwise obtained the package you wish to install, the process of installation is straightforward.
</p>

<p>
Double-click the package file to get started.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Step-by-step</h2>
<h3>1. Language Selection</h3>
<img alt="Language Selection" src="assets/install-01-language.jpg" />
<p>
The first step is selecting the language to be used throughout installation.  Please bear in mind that this <span style="font-weight: bold;">only applies to the installation process, and not the program itself</span>.
</p>

<hr />
<h3>2. Confirm Action</h3>
<img alt="Language Selection" src="assets/install-02-confirm.jpg" />
<p>
You will see a dialogue asking you to confirm that your intention is to install Parbat 3D on your computer.
</p>

<p>
Click &quot;Yes&quot; to continue, or &quot;No&quot; to abort.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>3. Welcome Screen</h3>
<img alt="Welcome Screen" src="assets/install-03-welcome.jpg" />
<p>
You will then see the welcome splash screen to the installer, which will give you a little information about the program, in an interface style familiar to most sentient life forms.
</p>


<p>
Clicking &quot;Next&quot; at this screen will allow you to proceed to the licensing terms and conditions.
</p>

<hr />
<h3>4. License Terms and Conditions</h3>
<p>
Parbat 3D is distributed under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">General Public License</a>.  This is a common Open-Source license, that assures your freedom to view and modify the source code of an application.
</p>

<img alt="License Agreement" src="assets/install-04-license.jpg" />

<p>
In order to proceed, you will have to accept the terms of the license agreement.  If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of the license, use of this software is illegal.
</p>

<hr />
<h3>5. Install Destination</h3>
<p>
You probably want to install Parbat 3D into the default directory, but should you be un-able or un-willing to do so, you will at this point be given the opportunity to select an alternate location.
</p>

<img alt="Install Location" src="assets/install-05-location.jpg" />

<p>
Once you have selected a reasonable installation directory, please press &quot;Next&quot; to continue.
</p>


<hr />
<h3>6. Selecting an Installation Type</h3>
<p>
There are a number of components bundled in the installer package.  You can at this point select which components are to be installed.
</p>

<img alt="Install Type" src="assets/install-06-type.jpg" />
<p>
Each selection corresponds to a set of components to be installed.  They are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Typical:</em> Install the most commonly used set of components.</li>
<li><em>Full:</em> Install every component, including source code.</li>
<li><em>Custom:</em> Select components for installation manually.  This option will display the component selection screen immediately after this one.</li>
<li><em>Minimal:</em> Install only required files to run the application.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3>7. Review</h3>
<img alt="Review" src="assets/install-07-review.jpg" />
<p>
At this stage, a summary screen is shown to allow you to review the options you have selected for the installation.
</p>

<p>
Clicking &quot;Next&quot; here will proceed to the file copy section of the installation.  If you wish to change your options or back out, here is your chance.
</p>

<hr />
<h3>8. Installation Progress</h3>
<img alt="Installation Progress" src="assets/install-08-progress.jpg" />
<p>
A progress dialog will be shown while the installer copies files and performs setup operations.
</p>

<p>
As Parbat 3D is only a few megabytes in size, we do not expect this stage to take more than a few moments.
</p>

<hr />
<h3>9. Installation Complete</h3>
<img alt="Installation Complete" src="assets/install-09-complete.jpg" />
<p>You can at this point choose to add a Parbat 3D shortcut to your Windows desktop (in addition to the one installed in the Start-&gt;Programs menu), and also select to start the application immediately.
