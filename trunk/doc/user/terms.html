<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Term</th>
    <th>Definition</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2D</td>
    <td>A representation of data (often an image) that uses two axes (usually labelled X and Y) to plot that data. This data is ideally suited to display on most media in use today.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3D</td>
    <td>A representation of data that uses three axes (usually labelled X, Y and Z) to plot that data. 3D representations of data that are viewed on a computer screen are not truly 3D, in that they do not occupy three dimensions in real space. Rather, they occupy the 2D space of the monitor's pixel grid, and change over time to represent the third dimension.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Digital Elevation Model (DEM)</td>
    <td>A 3D model of some area of terrain. A DEM can have images created by remote sensing "draped" over it to allow users to better visualise an area.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ECW (Enhanced Compression Wavelet)</td>
    <td>An image format that allows compression of imagery up to a ratio of 50:1 with almost no visual loss of information. It is specifically designed for geospatial imagery.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Feature Space</td>
    <td>A mathematical representation of the pixel data from a remote sensing image. Technically, it is “an n-dimensional space occupied by n input raster objects. Each raster object represents one dimension, and its cell values represent positions along one of the orthogonal coordinate axes in feature space.” In Parbat 3D, feature spaces are represented as 3D scatter plots.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GeoTIFF</td>
    <td>Based on TIFF specification, GeoTIFF defines a set of TIFF tags provided to describe all "Cartographic" information associated with TIFF imagery that originates from satellite imaging systems, scanned aerial photography, scanned maps, digital elevation models, or as a result of geographic analyses.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GNU Public License (GPL)</td>
    <td>A free public license that allows the distribution and modification of Open Source projects.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Isosurfaces</td>
    <td>A surface that represents points of a constant value (e.g. pressure, temperature, velocity, density) within a volume of space.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>JPEG 2000</td>
    <td>Another image file format that uses 'wavelet' technology. As well as being better at compressing images, it can allow an image to be retained without any distortion or loss. JPEG 2000 can retain the original uncompressed image file. It can be asked to produce continuingly higher resolution and higher quality copies of the image, up to and including the full resolution uncompressed original.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Metadata</td>
    <td>From the Latin, metadata simply means "data about data", and is used today to describe any ancillary information that helps categorise or describe another piece of information. For example, an image file might have a piece of metadata that describes what type of camera took the original image.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Regions of Interest (ROI)</td>
    <td>An area or areas of a remote sensing image that the user is interested in studying. In Parbat 3D, these will be represented by a group of pixels whose bounds are defined by one or more polygons.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Remote Sensing</td>
    <td>The science of acquiring, processing and interpreting images that record the interaction between electromagnetic energy and matter.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Spectral Band</td>
    <td>A part of the electromagnetic spectrum that has been recorded by a remote sensor, such as the near-infrared band, or the visible light band.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)</td>
    <td>A raster image file format developed by Aldus (now Adobe), which includes metadata 'tags' as part of the file. These tags can provide much useful data about a given image, such as native resolution, colour space information, and so forth.</td>
  </tr>
