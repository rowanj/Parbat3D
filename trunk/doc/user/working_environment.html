<h2>Hiding / Showing Windows</h2>

<p>The Overview window remains visible at all times, unless minimized. Clicking on the 'X' close button at the
top-right of the window will close the program.</p>
<img alt="Overview window" src="assets/overview_window.jpg">

<p>The extra windows can be shown/hidden by using the 'Window' menu.</p>
<img alt="Window menu" src="assets/window_menu.jpg">

<p>Each window listed under the 'Window' menu has a tick next to it if it is currently visible, or no tick if it is
hidden.<p>
<img alt="Window menu ticked" src="assets/window_menu_ticked.jpg">

<p>To change the visibility state of a window, simply click on one of the menu items. If a 'Window' menu item appears
to be grayed out or disabled, it can not be used during the current state of the program and therefore can not be
shown. An image must be loaded for all menu items to be available. See <a href="loading_image.html">Loading an Image</a></p>

<p>The extra windows can also be hidden by clicking on the 'X' close button button at the top-right of the window.</p>

<h2>Snapping Windows</h2>

<p>Parbat3D allows each of windows to be moved around independantly, or snapped together and moved around with the
Overview Window.</p>

<p>To move a window, press and hold the left mouse button on its title bar, move the mouse, then release the mouse
button.</p>

<p>To snap a window to another one, simply move it towards the second window until they touch each other.</p>

<p>To move multiple windows around the screen at the same time, snap them all to the Overview Window and then move
the Overview Window with the mouse.</p>
